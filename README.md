This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when starting an Expo project using `expo start`. The error message is often vague, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact cause. This example showcases a potential scenario and its solution.

## Problem

The project fails to start with an unclear error message, possibly related to dependencies or native modules.  Typical symptoms include failure to load Metro Bundler or other build-related issues. 

## Solution

The solution may involve several steps:

1. **Check package.json:** Ensure all dependencies are correctly specified and compatible with Expo. Check for version conflicts or missing peerDependencies.
2. **Verify EAS Build Configuration (if applicable):** If using EAS Build, review your EAS configuration file for any potential problems.
3. **Examine Native Modules:**  If you're using any native modules, make sure they're correctly installed and configured for your Expo project.
4. **Clean and Rebuild:**  Try cleaning the project's cache (removing the `node_modules` folder and reinstalling dependencies) before attempting to rebuild.
5. **Check Expo SDK Version:**  Ensure compatibility between Expo SDK version and used libraries. Check for updates and known issues related to used Expo SDK version
6. **Console logs:** Make sure to add console logs related to startup process. It may help you find the exact root cause of the problem.
