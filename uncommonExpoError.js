This error typically occurs when using Expo's `expo start` command and is related to incorrect configuration or dependencies within your project.  The message itself isn't very specific, making diagnosis challenging. The error might stem from problems with your package.json, EAS configurations (if using EAS Build), or issues with native modules that Expo is trying to load.
