The solution depends on the root cause.  This example shows how to identify and resolve a dependency conflict:

```javascript
// uncommonExpoErrorSolution.js
// ... project code ...

// Check if all dependencies are correctly specified and compatible
npm install --force

// Check for the existence of a package-lock.json file and remove it if present.
npm install

// Check if there are any conflicting dependencies and solve them.
```

Other solutions might involve debugging native modules, reviewing EAS Build configurations, or searching for similar issues reported by the Expo community.
